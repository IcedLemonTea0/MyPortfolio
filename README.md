***

This portfolio consists of all the collections of projects I have created for data analytical roles. I have no prior professional experience in any analytical field but I have invested my time in learning and improving from every project that I completed. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the viewers my technical and analytical capability as an aspiring candidate for analytical role.  

My goal is to show others that I am detail-oriented, I pay attention to details and structure of what the problem is. I prioritize methodological practice to provide an accurate and reliable analysis. And finally, communicating my work in a clear and logical manner in which any individual can follow.  

Keep growing.

Consumers complaints are an integral process on highlighting how consumers feel about a certain business or products. This is an exploratory data analysis problem: based on data retrieved from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2011 - 2016. This datasets provides crucial concerns by the consumers regarding financial institutions practices and their responses to consumers. In it, I will explore using visualization tools to summarize these concerns and explain interesting trends that many consumers feel about the marketplace.
