# Data Analyst Portfolio by Amir Gharti Magar

***

This portfolio consists of all the collections of projects I have created for data analytical roles. I have no prior professional experience in any analytical field but I have invested my time in learning and improving from every project that I completed. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the viewers my technical and analytical capability as an aspiring candidate for analytical role.  

My goal is to show others that I am detail-oriented, I pay attention to details and structure of what the problem is. I prioritize methodological practice to provide an accurate and reliable analysis. And finally, communicating my work in a clear and logical manner in which any individual can follow.  

Keep growing.
